        <p>My name is Tiffany Pang, born in Hong Kong, raised in New York City, currently living in Seoul. I moved to Seoul about 4 years ago, so I've studied a bit and worked a bit. 
            I recently quit my job at a Korean company, and I'm attending a web development bootcamp to learn an extra skill and boost my career path. So I spend my time just studying and seeing friends. Some of my hobbies include yoga and traveling, and I like to vlog my travels sometimes to keep them as memories, so I have a YouTube channel just for fun.
